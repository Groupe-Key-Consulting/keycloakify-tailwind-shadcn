# üöÄ Keycloakify + Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI: Enhancing Keycloak Themes üöÄ

Welcome to the Keycloakify + Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI repository! This project is a community-driven effort aimed at making Keycloak theming more accessible, modern, and easy to customize. By integrating Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI, I am upgrading the Keycloakify ecosystem, one page at a time, to meet the needs of modern front-end development.

This project is designed to be developer-friendly, making it easy to customize themes or individual components to suit your specific needs. With the help of Storybook, developers can modify components in isolation, streamlining the customization process.

I strongly believe in the Keycloak ecosystem and found Keycloakify to be an extremely stable and reliable tool for creating custom Keycloak themes. My goal is to further enhance Keycloakify for this specific front-end use case and to make it easier for others to build on top of my work.

## üõ† Tailwind CSS & ShadCN UI Integration

This project integrates Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components with Keycloakify, making it easier to create custom Keycloak themes. You can easily customize individual components or the entire theme by leveraging Storybook.

Isolated Component Customization with Storybook: Every component in this project is storybook-ready, allowing you to develop and customize components in isolation. This means you can focus on fine-tuning each UI element without worrying about the rest of the application. Storybook helps in visually testing and experimenting with different styles and themes.
With the integration of Tailwind CSS, you get access to utility-first CSS for rapid styling, while ShadCN UI components provide a robust design system for professional UIs.
